# Canvas Integration

The application integrates with Canvas LMS for importing courses, assignments, and user data.

## Key Components

- [src/services/canvasIntegrationService.ts](mdc:src/services/canvasIntegrationService.ts) - Canvas credentials and sync management
- [src/services/canvasApi.ts](mdc:src/services/canvasApi.ts) - API calls to Canvas LMS
- [src/components/canvas](mdc:src/components/canvas) - Canvas-specific UI components

## Integration Features

1. **User Authentication** - Store and manage Canvas API tokens
2. **Course Synchronization** - Import courses and assignments
3. **Data Syncing** - Track last sync date and manage periodic updates
4. **Credentials Management** - Add, update, and remove Canvas credentials

## Implementation Details

The application uses Supabase to store Canvas credentials securely and tracks synchronization timestamps to optimize API usage.

## Canvas API Usage

The integration uses the Canvas REST API for retrieving user data, courses, assignments, and other learning resources as needed.
