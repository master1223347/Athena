# Routing Structure

The application uses React Router for navigation with a protected route system.

## Route Configuration

The main routing configuration is in [src/App.tsx](mdc:src/App.tsx) with these key route guards:

- `RequireAuth` - Ensures users are authenticated before accessing protected routes
- `RequireUnauth` - Redirects authenticated users away from auth pages (login/register)

## Main Routes

### Public Routes
- `/landing` - Landing page for non-authenticated users
- `/login` - User login page
- `/register` - User registration page

### Protected Routes
- `/` - Main dashboard
- `/courses` - Courses listing and management
- `/progress` - User learning progress
- `/calendar` - Schedule and events
- `/settings` - User settings
- `/achievements` - User achievements
- `/help` - Help and support

### Other Routes
- `*` - NotFound page for 404 handling
